This Java program presents a classic number guessing game, where players aim to correctly identify a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game structure consists of multiple rounds, each offering players a finite number of attempts to guess the target number. As participants progress through the rounds, they receive feedback on whether their guesses are higher or lower than the actual number, guiding their subsequent attempts.

Scoring in the game is determined by the efficiency of the player's guesses. Points are awarded based on the number of attempts left after successfully guessing the number within the round. The total score is a cumulative sum of points earned across all completed rounds. Players can fine-tune the game experience by adjusting parameters such as the range of the random number generator and the maximum number of attempts allowed per round directly within the code.

To engage with the game, users need to compile the provided Java file and run the resulting program. Upon completion of the designated number of rounds, the game concludes, and the player's total score is displayed. Additionally, contributions to the project, including suggesting improvements or submitting code enhancements, are openly welcomed, fostering a collaborative environment for game development and refinement.
